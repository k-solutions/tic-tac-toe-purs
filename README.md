# TicTacToe Haloogen Hooks


A PureScript Halogen Hook port of the official reactjs.org documentation's [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) example.

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

The browser will display a functioning tic-tac-toe game that:
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
